# Enigma-Machine

This project simulates the Enigma cipher machine using Java and JavaFX. It offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

## Overview

The Enigma machine was a cipher device used during World War II for the encryption and decryption of secret messages. This project aims to recreate the functionality of the Enigma machine in software form.

## Features

- Encryption and decryption of messages using the Enigma cipher algorithm.
- Support for various rotor configurations and plugboard settings.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for text-based interaction.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX for a more intuitive user experience.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

To use the command-line interface, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
2. Run the program using `java EnigmaCLI`.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the message, rotor settings, and plugboard configuration.
4. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message.
5. View the encrypted or decrypted message.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To use the graphical user interface, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java files using `javac *.java`.
2. Run the program using `java EnigmaGUI`.
3. Use the graphical interface to input the message, rotor settings, and plugboard configuration.
4. Click on the appropriate buttons to encrypt or decrypt the message.
5. View the encrypted or decrypted message in the designated output area.
